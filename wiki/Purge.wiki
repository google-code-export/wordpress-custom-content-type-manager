||https://img.skitch.com/20120215-gaaruiq48wypsgu2kf5ttdbm6.jpg|| The Purge tool was added to the CCTM in version 0.9.5.7: it allows you to remove orphaned rows from your database.  If you created multiple posts under one post-type, then you removed that post-type definition, you may still have many unused rows in your database.||

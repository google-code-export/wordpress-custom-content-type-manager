#summary Where to download this plugin

= Where to Download =

Normally his plugin can be downloaded from the !WordPress.org site:

[http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom-content-type-manager/ http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom-content-type-manager/]

If the !WordPress repository is experiencing problems, I try to keep the most recent version of the plugin available as a zip file: [http://wpcctm.com/custom-content-type-manager.zip http://wpcctm.com/custom-content-type-manager.zip]

The most current development branch of this project is available as a zip file:

http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/custom-content-type-manager.zip

Or it is available via SVN:

_"Sir, it's quite possible this development branch is not entirely stable."_

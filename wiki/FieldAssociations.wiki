= Associating Fields with Content Types =

As of version 0.9.4, custom field definitions are _normalized_: you define the field once and you can add it to any content type.  As of version 0.9.7, you can create custom metaboxes to control where each field appears.

There are 2 places where you can make this association:

 * *Custom Content Types --> Custom Content Types --> {_choose a content type_} --> Manage Custom Fields*
 * *Custom Content Types --> Custom Fields --> {_choose a field_} --> Edit*

If you choose the first, you can affect the order that the fields display in by dragging and dropping the fields into the order you want them.

----------------------
== Manage Custom Fields ==

This is the best place to manage custom fields because it allows you determine the order of the fields and where they will appear on the page.

*Custom Content Types --> Custom Content Types --> {_choose a content type_} --> Manage Custom Fields*

Drag fields from the "Unused Fields" on the left into the metabox where you want them to appear.  You can click the "Create Metabox" button to create a new metabox.


---------------
== Edit a Custom Field ==

This option lets you manage the associations with limited control: you only get to choose which post-type the custom field is used on.  It will appear in the default metabox.

*Custom Content Types --> Custom Fields --> {_choose a field_} --> Edit*

Check the content types where you want this field displayed and then click *Save*. 

You must go to the *Manage Custom Fields* edit screen to set the order of the fields!

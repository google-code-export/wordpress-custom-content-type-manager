User fields are used to store a foreign key reference to a user.  Because the raw user ID is not terribly useful in and of itself, user fields most often will most often rely on the [userinfo_OutputFilter userinfo] output filter to translate and format the information represented by the user ID.

== Field Definition (Meta Data)==

The field definition affects how instances of this field type will display in the !WordPress manager while creating or posts that contain instances of this field type.

 * *label* : the label identifies this field when you create or edit a post in the !WordPress manager
 * *name* : the name is a unique identifier used when saving values for instances of this field; it corresponds to the *meta_key* column *wp_postmeta* table.  You will use this name when retrieving field values inside of your themes via the `print_custom_field()` or `get_custom_field()` functions.
 * *description* : the description provides extra information to users as they create or edit a post in the !WordPress manager.
 * *class* : this affects the CSS class in the !WordPress manager that is used to display instances of this field type.
 * *extra* : this can be used to provide additional parameters to the text input, e.g. `size="10"` or custom javascript.
 * *default_value* : This is used to determine the default value for new instances of this field type. 
 * *output_filter* : [OutputFilters Output Filters] control how data is filtered before being sent to your theme files. The recommended default output filter for a user field is _userinfo_

== Example of Use  in Template File ==


=== Example 1: Retrieve the src of the Image ===

Here we show how to use the [to_image_src_OutputFilter to_image_src] Output Filter:

{{{
<?php 
$userinfo = get_custom_field('my_user:userinfo'); 
print_r($userinfo); // see what info is available!
?>
}}}

|| http://s2.postimage.org/by3ngezo/warning_icon.png || In the case of a user field with no output filter, `print_custom_field('fieldname');` will return _an integer number_ representing the ID of the user that has been referenced!  || 


=== Recommended Output Filters ===

 * [userinfo_OutputFilter userinfo]

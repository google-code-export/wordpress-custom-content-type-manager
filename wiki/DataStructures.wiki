Note that each node of the _cctm_post_type_def_ array should be passable to the `register_post_type()` function below without any modification.  The keys that are not native to !WordPress are prefaced with "cctm_", e.g.  

 * *cctm_hierarchical_includes_drafts*: will cause !WordPress' parent selector to include unpublished pages
 * *cctm_hierarchical_post_types*: this determines which post types are viable candidates for parents.

 

= register_post_type =

For the record, this demonstrates sample input for !WordPress' `register_post_type()` function:

{{{
	$def = Array
	(
	    'supports' => Array
	        (
	            'title',
	            'editor'
	        ),

	    'post_type' => 'book',
	    'singular_label' => 'Book',
	    'label' => 'Books',
	    'description' => 'What I&#039;m reading',
	    'show_ui' => 1,
	    'capability_type' => 'post',
	    'public' => 1,
	    'menu_position' => '10',
	    'menu_icon' => '',
	    'show_in_nav_menus' => '',
	    'can_export' => '',
	    'is_active' => 1,
	);

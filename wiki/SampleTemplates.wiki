= Sample Templates =

Each time you create a custom content type with custom fields, you have to have a customized template to display that type of data.  Go to the *Custom Content Types* menu in your !WordPress dashboard and click on the first menu item: *Custom Content Types*.  For each content type defined, there is a link to *View Sample Template*.  This provides a sample template and detailed instructions on where to save it and how it needs to be named.

The sample template displayed includes examples of the `print_custom_field()` and `get_custom_field()` functions: these have to be used to get at the data you store in your custom fields.  The samples include a sample view on how to use [OutputFilters Output Filters]: some types of data cannot simply be printed, so I've included examples of how to use the default Output Filter set for each custom field.

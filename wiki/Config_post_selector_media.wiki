||https://img.skitch.com/20120201-r687d2fxjkdfg6feua52t6wwc8.jpg||All CCTM customizations rely on the same principle: if you create your own configuration file it will override the built-in default configuration file.  Several areas of functionality can be controlled via this method. See [Customizations] for more info.||

To customize the configuration for all relation fields, perform the following steps:

 # Via FTP, navigate to your site's *wp-content/uploads* folder.  If there isn't already a folder named *cctm* there, create it.  NOTE: change this if you have customized the location of your uploads folder.
 # Inside of the *cctm* folder, create a folder named "config" (it may already exist).  
 # Inside of the *config* folder, create a folder named "post_selector"
 # Into the *post_selector* folder, copy the *_media.php* file from `wp-content/plugins/custom-content-type-manager/config/post_selector/_media.php`.

The end goal here is to have a file inside your _own_ folder outside the CCTM's folder.  <font color="red">*DO NOT EDIT FILES INSIDE THE CCTM's FOLDER*</font>.  Any plugin files may be deleted or updated during an upgrade, so those files are off-limits!

Update your copy of the `_media.php` file so that it contains the search criteria you need.  For example, if you want the search function to only search for post_titles (instead of searching titles and content), update the file to contain a line like the following:

{{{
CCTM::$post_selector['search_columns'] = array('post_title');
CCTM::$post_selector['post_type'] = 'attachment';
CCTM::$post_selector['post_mime_type'] = '';
CCTM::$post_selector['post_status'] = array('publish','inherit');
CCTM::$post_selector['orderby'] = 'ID';
CCTM::$post_selector['order'] = 'DESC';
CCTM::$post_selector['limit'] = 10;
CCTM::$post_selector['paginate'] = 1;

CCTM::$search_by = array();
CCTM::$search_by[] = 'post_type';
CCTM::$search_by[] = 'post_status';
CCTM::$search_by[] = 'taxonomy';
CCTM::$search_by[] = 'taxonomy_term';
CCTM::$search_by[] = 'post_parent';
CCTM::$search_by[] = 'meta_key';
CCTM::$search_by[] = 'meta_value';
}}}

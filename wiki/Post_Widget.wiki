= Settings =

 * *Post Type:* This dropdown will limit the choices available to you when you click the "Choose Post" button.
 * *Choose Post:* clicking this button will launch a lightbox that will allow you to browse the available posts, pages, etc. (depending on the value set in the "Post Type" dropdown).  Select the post you want.
 * *Override Post Title:* by checking this box, you can type your own value into the "Title" field; if unchecked, the title of the selected post will be used for the title of the widget.
 * *Title:* The value in this text field will appear above the widget if "Override Post Title" is checked.
 * *Formatting String:* this is what formats each result returned.  _It should be a list item_!

The default formatting string is simply this:

{{{
[+post_content+]
}}}

Note that the formatting string uses `[+placeholders+]` that get replaced with data, just as the formatting templates do when you [CustomizingManagerHTML customize the Manager HTML].  Any field available to the posts you are listing will have a  corresponding placeholder.  This includes all built-in columns to the wp_posts table AND any custom fields you have defined.  You can use the `[+help+]` placeholder to print out any available placeholders for you.

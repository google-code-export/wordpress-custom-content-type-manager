Starting with version 0.9.5, the CCTM caches data to ensure a speedier performance of the !WordPress manager.

== Images ==

Thumbnail images in the post-selector are cached: the built-in !WordPress for this simply did not work, so if you had uploaded a bunch of huge images, then the post-selector would load _all_ of them in their _full_ sizes.  So wrote my own thumbnail generation script.... the thumbnails are pretty poor quality, but using tiny images does not strain the manager. You can always preview the full-sized image.

=== Location ===

Images are cached inside a sub-folder of your uploads directory:

`wp-content/uploads/cctm/cache/images`
